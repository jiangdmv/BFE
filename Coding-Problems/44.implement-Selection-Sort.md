#

### Problem Description

Even for Front-End Engineer, it is a must to understand how basic sorting algorithms work.

Now you are asked to implement [Selection sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort), which sorts an integer array in ascending order.

Do it **in-place**, no need to return anything.

**Follow-up**

What is time cost for average / worst case ? Is it stable?

#

### Solution

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 */
function selectionSort(arr) {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    let smallestIndex = i;
    for (let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
      if (arr[j] < arr[smallestIndex]) {
        smallestIndex = j;
      }
    }
    if (smallestIndex !== i) {
      [arr[smallestIndex], arr[i]] = [arr[i], arr[smallestIndex]];
    }
  }
}
```
