# 61. create your own `Function.prototype.call`

### Problem

#

### Problem Description

[Function.prototype.call](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-function.prototype.call) is very useful when we want to alter the `this` of a function.

Can you implement your own `myCall`, which returns the same result as `Function.prototype.call`?

For the [newest ECMAScript spec](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-function.prototype.call), `thisArg` are not transformed. And not replaced with window in [Strict Mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode).

Your implementation should follow above spec and do what non Strict Mode does.

`Function.prototype.cal/apply/bind` and [Reflect.apply](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Reflect/apply) should not be used.

### Solution

```js
Function.prototype.mycall = function (thisArg, ...args) {
  // thisArg can be null or defined.
  thisArg = thisArg || window;

  // Transform primitive value into object, so that we can add property.
  thisArg = Object(thisArg);

  // Create a unique property name.
  const fn = Symbol();

  // Assign the function that has to be called to the unique property.
  thisArg[fn] = this;

  // Call the function as a method to get the correct context.
  const returnValue = thisArg[fn](...args);

  // Delete the unique property so that the original thisArg is not affected.
  delete thisArg[fn];
  return returnValue;
};
```
