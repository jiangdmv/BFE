### Problem Description

Luckily we have [BigInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt) in JavaScript so handle big numbers.

What if we need to do it by ourselves for older browsers?

You are asked to implement a string addition function, **with all non-negative integers in string**.

```js
add('999999999999999999', '1');
// '1000000000000000000'
```

Don't use BigInt directly, it is not our goal here.

#

### Understanding the problem

Because there is a maximal range of values the data type `Number` can hold, to handle integers that exceed the maximal range we need to use the dataType `BigInt`. We need to implement a function that takes two non-negative integers of arbitrary length as input and returns the sum of them without using `BigInt`. The two numbers are represented as `string`s. The return value should be also a `string`.

#

### Approach

Perform a digits-by-digits sum starting from the end of both strings, which is the least significant digit. Use a variable to keep track of the carry and use another variable to store the result. At each iteration, add the two digits at the same position and the carry; if the sum 'overflows', calculate the carry and bring it to the next iteration; update the result.

### Solution

```js
/**
 * @param {string} num1
 * @param {string} num2
 * @return {string}
 */
function add(num1, num2) {
  // Use two pointers to keep track of the digit in the strings,
  // set both pointers to the end of the strings.
  let i = num1.length - 1;
  let j = num2.length - 1;
  // Keep track of the carry.
  let carry = 0;
  let result = '';

  // Iterate through both strings backwards,
  // until the beginning of both strings is reached and there
  // is no carry that needs to add to the result.
  while (i >= 0 || j >= 0 || carry > 0) {
    // Get digits at current position in both strings.
    // If undefined, set to zero.
    const digit1 = Number(num1[i] || 0);
    const digit2 = Number(num2[j] || 0);
    // Add both digits and previous carry.
    let sum = digit1 + digit2 + carry;
    // If the sum "overflows", bring over the carry to the next iteration.
    carry = sum >= 10 ? 1 : 0;
    // Get the ones digit of the sum.
    sum = sum % 10;
    // Add the ones digit to the beginning of the result.
    result = String(sum) + result;
    i--;
    j--;
  }

  return result;
}
```
