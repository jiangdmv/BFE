### Problem Description

This is a follow-up on [57. create an Observable](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/create-an-Observable).

There are [a lot of operators](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/operators) for Observable, if we think of Observable as event stream, then modifying the stream is a common task, transformation operators are useful at this.

In this problem, you are asked to implement [map()](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/api/operators/map), as the name indicates, it maps the value to another value thus creating a new event stream.

Here is an example.

```js
const source = Observable.from([1, 2, 3]);

map((x) => x * x)(source) // this transformer doubles numbers and create a new stream
  .subscribe(console.log);
// 1
// 4
// 9
```

Observable has `pipe()` method which could make this more readable.

```js
const source = Observable.from([1, 2, 3]);

source.pipe(map((x) => x * x)).subscribe(console.log);
// 1
// 4
// 9
```

**Note** Observable is already given for you, no need to create it.

#

### Understanding the problem

I am asked to write a function called `map()`. It should take in a function that is going to be called on each value emitted by the source Observable. It should return a function that will receive the source Observable and returns the transformed Observable. The class `Observable` is provided for me.

#

### Approach

In the `map` function, first I need to return a function which takes in an observable as source and returns the transformed observable.

```js
function map(transform) {
  return (sourceObservable) => {
    // return transformedObservable
  };
}
```

In a observable, the value that the observable emits is going to be passed to `subscriber.next(value)`. Therefore, in order to apply the `transform` function on each value the source observable emits, I need to wrap the `subscriber.next(value)`:

```js
// store the original subscriber.next
subscriber.next = (value) => {
  value = transform(value);
  // invoke the original subscriber.next passing
  // in the transformed value.
};
```

That means, I need to create a new `Observable` instance; wrap the `subscriber.next(value)` in the `setup` of the new `Observable` and invoke the source observable `subscriber` passing in the modified `subscriber`.

```js
return (sourceObservable) => {
  const transformedObservable = new Observable((subscriber) => {
    subscriber.next = (value) => {
      // ...
    };
    sourceObservable.subscribe(subscriber);
  });
  // return transformedObservable
};
```

Return the transformed observable at the end.

### Solution

```js
/**
 * @param {any} input
 * @return {(observable: Observable) => Observable}
 * returns a function which transform Observable
 */
function map(transform) {
  return (source) => {
    return new Observable((subscriber) => {
      const originalNext = subscriber.next;
      subscriber.next = (value) => {
        const newValue = transform(value);
        originalNext.call(subscriber, newValue);
      };
      source.subscribe(subscriber);
    });
  };
}
```
