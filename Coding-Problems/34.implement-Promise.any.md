# 34. implement `Promise.any()`

### Problem

#

### Problem Description

> Promise.any() takes an iterable of Promise objects and, as soon as one of the promises in the iterable fulfils, returns a single promise that resolves with the value from that promise

from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/any)

Can you implement a `any()` to work the same as `Promise.any()`?

**note**

`AggregateError` is not supported in Chrome yet, but you can still use it in your code since we will add the Class into your code. Do something like following:

```js
new AggregateError('No Promise in Promise.any was resolved', errors);
```

#

### Solution

```js
/**
 * @param {Array<Promise>} promises
 * @return {Promise}
 */
function any(promises) {
  if (promises.length === 0) {
    return Promise.resolve();
  }

  let isFulfilled = false;
  const errors = Array(promises.length);
  let numOfErrors = 0;

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    promises.forEach((promise, i) => {
      if (!(promise instanceof Promise)) {
        promise = Promise.resolve(promise);
      }

      promise.then(
        (value) => {
          if (isFulfilled) {
            return;
          }

          resolve(value);
          isFulfilled = true;
        },
        (reason) => {
          errors[i] = reason;
          numOfErrors++;

          if (numOfErrors === promises.length) {
            reject(
              new AggregateError(
                'No Promise in Promise.any was resolved',
                errors
              )
            );
          }
        }
      );
    });
  });
}
```
