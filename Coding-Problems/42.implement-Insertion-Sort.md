#

### Problem Description

Even for Front-End Engineer, it is a must to understand how basic sorting algorithms work.

Now you are asked to implement [Insertion Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort), which sorts an integer array in ascending order.

Do it **in-place**, no need to return anything.

**Follow-up**

What is time cost for average / worst case ? Is it stable?

#

### Solution

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 */
function insertionSort(arr) {
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    let currentVal = arr[i];
    let j = i - 1;
    while (j >= 0 && currentVal < arr[j]) {
      arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
      j--;
    }
    arr[j + 1] = currentVal;
  }
}
```
