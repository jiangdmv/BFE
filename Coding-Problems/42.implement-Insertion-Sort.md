### Problem Description

Even for Front-End Engineer, it is a must to understand how basic sorting algorithms work.

Now you are asked to implement [Insertion Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort), which sorts an integer array in ascending order.

Do it **in-place**, no need to return anything.

**Follow-up**

What is time cost for average / worst case ? Is it stable?

### Solution

| Sorting Algorithms | Average Time Complexity | Best Time Complexity | Worst Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Stability |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| Insertion sort     | O(n<sup>2</sup>)        | O(n)                 | O(n<sup>2</sup>)      | O(1)             | stable    |

```js
function insertionSort(arr) {
  let current;
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    current = arr[i];
    while (i >= 1 && current < arr[i - 1]) {
      arr[i] = arr[i - 1];
      i--;
    }
    arr[i] = current;
  }
}
```
