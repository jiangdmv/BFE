# 17. create a simple store for DOM element

### Problem

https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/create-a-simple-store-for-DOM-node

#

### Problem Description

We have `Map` in es6, so we could use any data as key, such as DOM element.

```js
const map = new Map();
map.set(domNode, somedata);
```

What if we need to support old JavaScript env like es5, how would you create your own Node Store as above?

You are asked to implement a Node Store, which supports DOM element as key.

```js
class NodeStore {
  set(node, value) {}

  get(node) {}

  has(node) {}
}
```

**note**

`Map` is disabled when judging your code, it is against the goal of practicing.

You can create a simple general `Map` polyfill. Or since you are asked to support specially for DOM element, what is special about DOM element?

What is the Time / Space cost of your solution?

### Solution

```js
class NodeStore {
  constructor() {
    this.nodes = {};
  }
  /**
   * @param {Node} node
   * @param {any} value
   */
  set(node, value) {
    node.__id__ = Symbol();
    this.nodes[node.__id__] = value;
  }
  /**
   * @param {Node} node
   * @return {any}
   */
  get(node) {
    return this.nodes[node.__id__];
  }

  /**
   * @param {Node} node
   * @return {Boolean}
   */
  has(node) {
    // coerce to boolean value
    return !!this.nodes[node.__id__];
  }
}
```
