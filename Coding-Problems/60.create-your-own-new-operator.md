# 60. create your own `new` operator

### Problem

https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/create-your-own-new-operator

#

### Problem Description

`new` [operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new) is used to create new instance objects.

Do you know exactly what `new` does?

You are asked to implement `myNew()`, which should return an object just as what `new` does but without using `new`.

Pay attention to the return type of constructor.

#

### Solution

```js
/**
 * @param {Function} constructor
 * @param {any[]} args - argument passed to the constructor
 * `myNew(constructor, ...args)` should return the same as `new constructor(...args)`
 */
const myNew = (constructor, ...args) => {
  // The `Object.create()` method creates a new empty object, using the
  // specified object as the prototype of the newly created object.
  const obj = Object.create(constructor.prototype);

  // Call constructor with obj as its context and
  // stored its return value in the variable returnValue.
  const returnValue = constructor.apply(obj, args);

  // If returnValue is an object, return returnValue, otherwise return obj.
  // Usually, constructors do not have return statement. The new operator
  // creates an object, assign it to this, and automatically returns that
  // object as a result. If a constructor has return statement and the return
  // value is an object, the object is returned instead of the newly created
  // object, otherwise the return value is ignored.
  return returnValue instanceof Object ? returnValue : obj;
};
```
