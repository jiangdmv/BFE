# 14. Implement a general memoization function - `memo()`

#

### Problem Description

[Memoization](https://whatthefuck.is/memoization) is a common technique to boost performance. If you use React, you definitely have used `React.memo` before.

Memoization is also commonly used in algorithm problem, when you have a recursion solution, in most cases, you can improve it by memoization, and then you might be able to get a Dynamic Programming approach.

So could you implement a general `memo()` function, which cache the result once called, so when same arguments are passed in, the result will be returned right away.

```js
const func = (arg1, arg2) => {
  return arg1 + arg2;
};

const memoed = memo(func);

memoed(1, 2);
// 3, func is called

memoed(1, 2);
// 3 is returned right away without calling func

memoed(1, 3);
// 4, new arguments, so func is called
```

The parameters are arbitrary, so memo should accept an extra resolver parameter, which is used to generate the cache key, like what [\_.memoize()](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#memoize) does.

```js
const memoed = memo(func, () => 'samekey');

memoed(1, 2);
// 3, func is called, 3 is cache with key 'samekey'

memoed(1, 2);
// 3, since key is the same, 3 is returned without calling func

memoed(1, 3);
// 3, since key is the same, 3 is returned without calling func
```

Default cache key could be just `Array.from(arguments).join('_')`

**note**

It is a trade-off of space for time, so if you use this in an interview, please do analyze how much space it might cost

#

### Solution

```js
/**
 * @param {Function} func
 * @param {(args:[]) => string }  [resolver] - cache key generator
 */
function memo(func, resolver) {
  const cache = new Map();

  return function (...args) {
    const key = resolver ? resolver(...args) : args.join('_');
    if (cache.has(key)) {
      return cache.get(key);
    }

    const result = func.apply(this, args);
    cache.set(key, result);
    return result;
  };
}
```
