#

### Problem Description

Luckily we already have built-in support of [BigInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt) in JavaScript, at least in some browsers.

```js
1000000000000000000000n - 999999999999999999999n;
// 1n
```

Suppose BigInt cannot be used, can you implement a string subtraction function by yourself?

```js
subtract('1000000000000000000000', '999999999999999999999');
// '1'
```

All input are valid **non-negative integer strings**, and the result is guaranteed to be non-negative.

#

### Understanding the problem

Since there is a maximal range of values that the data type `Number` can store, to handle values that exceed that range, we can use the data type `BigInt`. If `BigInt` is not supported, we can store them as strings. I am asked to write a function that can performs string subtraction. The function takes in two parameters, where the first parameter is the minuend and the second parameter is subtrahend, and it should return the result as a string. All input are not negative and they are integer strings. The result is guaranteed to be non-negative.

#

### Approach

I can solve the problem by subtracting these two integer strings digit by digit starting from the least significant digit and keep track of the borrow.

- Initialize two pointers that are going to keep track of the position we are at in these two strings respectively. I would call them `minuendIdx` and `subtrahendIdx`; point `minuendIdx` to the end of the first string and `subtrahendIdx` to the end of the second string.
- Initialize a variable that is going to keep track of the borrow from the previous subtraction; set it to 0. Initialize an empty array that is going to store the results of all these subtractions.
- Since the result is guaranteed to be non-negative, that means the length of the second string is going to be less than or equal to the length of the first string. Loop until the beginning of the first string is reached. At each iteration,
  - Get the 'digit' the `minuendIdx` points to, and the 'digit' the `subtrahendIdx` points to. Since the length of the subtrahend string might be shorter than the minuend string, the 'digit' the `subtrahendIdx` points to can be `undefined`, so I need to provide a default value which is 0.
  - Convert both 'digits' to numbers. Subtract the borrow carried from the previous subtraction from the minuend digit and set the result as the actual minuend digit. If the minuend digit is smaller than the subtrahend digit, add 10 to the minuend digit and carry `1` to the next iteration; otherwise, reset the borrow to 0.
  - Subtract these two numbers and append their difference to the array of results.
  - Decrease both `minuendIdx` and `subtrahendIdx` by 1.
- Remove the leading 0s from the resulting string and return it.
  Suppose the two strings are `100` and `99`, when I get out of the loop, the result is going to be `[1, 0, 0]`, in which the less significant digits come first. After reversing it and converting it to string, I will get `001`. Therefore I need to drop the 0s at the beginning of the string. To do that, I can loop over the array starting from the end of the array. At each iteration, if the number is 0, drop it. Break out of the loop, if I encounter a number that is not 0 for the first time or the array has only one number left. Reverse the array, then convert it to a string and return the string.

### Solution

```js
/**
 * @param {string} minuend
 * @param {string} subtrahend
 * @return {string}
 */
function subtract(minuend, subtrahend) {
  let minuendIdx = minuend.length - 1;
  let subtrahendIdx = subtrahend.length - 1;
  let borrow = 0;
  const results = [];

  while (minuendIdx >= 0) {
    let minuendDigit = Number(minuend[minuendIdx]) - borrow;
    const subtrahendDigit = Number(subtrahend[subtrahendIdx] || 0);

    if (minuendDigit < subtrahendDigit) {
      borrow = 1;
      minuendDigit += 10;
    } else {
      borrow = 0;
    }

    const difference = minuendDigit - subtrahendDigit;
    results.push(difference);

    minuendIdx--;
    subtrahendIdx--;
  }

  while (results[results.length - 1] === 0 && results.length > 1) {
    results.pop();
  }

  return results.reverse().join('');
}
```
