### Problem Description

This is a follow-up on [36. create a fake timer(setTimeout)](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/create-a-fake-timer)

Like `setTimeout`, `setInterval` also is not accurate. (please refer [Event Loop](https://javascript.info/event-loop) for detail).

This is OK in general web application, but might be problematic in test.

Could you implement your own `setInterval()` and `clearInterval()` to be sync? so that they have **accurate timing** for test. This is what [FakeTimes](https://github.com/sinonjs/fake-timers) are for.

By "accurate", it means **suppose all functions cost no time**, we start our function at time `0`, then `setInterval(func1, 100)` would schedule `func1` exactly at `100, 200, 300 .etc`.

You need to replace `Date.now()` as well to provide the time.

```js
class FakeTimer {
  install() {
    // replace window.setInterval, window.clearInterval, Date.now
    // with your implementation
  }

  uninstall() {
    // restore the original implementation of
    // window.setInterval, window.clearInterval, Date.now
  }

  tick() {
    // run the scheduled functions without waiting
  }
}
```

** Be careful about the infinite loops **. Your code is tested like this:

```js
const fakeTimer = new FakeTimer();
fakeTimer.install();

const logs = [];
const log = () => {
  logs.push(Date.now());
};

let count = 0;
const id = setInterval(() => {
  if (count > 1) {
    clearInterval(id);
  } else {
    log();
  }
  count += 1;
}, 100);
// log 'A' at every 100, stop at 200
fakeTimer.tick();
fakeTimer.uninstall();

expect(logs).toEqual([100, 200]);
```

**Note**

Only `Date.now()` is used when judging your code, you can ignore other time related apis.

### Understanding the problem

I am asked to implement a `FakeTimer` class which is going to have three methods: `install()`, `uninstall()` and `tick()`. The `install()` method is going to replace the built-in `setInterval()`, `clearInterval()` and `Date.now()` with my implementation of the three methods and the `uninstall()` method is going to restore the original implementation:

- My implementation of `setInterval()` is going to take in a callback function and the amount of time to delay the execution of the function as arguments. Unlike the built-in `setInterval()`, it will only queue/schedule the specified callback function but will not actually set the interval timer.

- My version of `clearInterval(id)` will stop the repeated execution of the specified function.

- My `Date.now()` is going to return the "current" time, which is the total amount of time that a scheduled function has been 'waited' before it executes, for instance, the following code snippet should logs `100, 200`:

  ```js
  setInterval(() => {
    console.log(Date.now);
  }, 100);
  ```

The `tick()` method is going to run the scheduled functions without waiting. In other words, the scheduled functions don't need to actually wait the specified amount of time before they start execution. In addition, for this problem, I don't need to handle multiple `setInterval()` calls or nested `setInterval()`, which means initially there is only one callback function.

#

### Approach

In the constructor of the `FakeTimer` class, I am going to first store the original implementation of `setInterval()`, `clearInterval()` and `Date.now()`. Then I will initialize a property called `taskQueue` to be an empty array that is going to store the scheduled functions. I am also going to initialize a property named `currTime` that is going to keep track of the 'current' time; initially set it to `0`.

In the `install()` method, I am going to define my implementation of these three functions and set `window.setInterval()`, `window.clearInterval` and `Date.now` to my implementation:

- `setInterval()` is going to take in a callback function and the amount of the time to delay. I am going to append the callback function to the `taskQueue` array and store its delay as well as its id alongside with it. The id is going to be equal to the length of the `taskQueue` array. At the very end of the function I will return the id.

- `clearInterval(id)` is going to delete all the scheduled functions with that specified `id` in the `taskQueue` array.

- `Date.now()` is going to just return the `currTime`.

In the `uninstall()` method, I am going to set `window.setInterval()`, `window.clearInterval` and `Date.now` back to the original implementation that I have stored.

In the `tick()` method, first I am going to pop the oldest callback function off the `taskQueue` array and set the `currTime` to its delay. Then I would update the delay by adding `currTime` to it, and append the callback function to the `taskQueue` with the updated delay. Lastly, I would execute the callback function. The reason that I call the callback function after pushing it back to the `taskQueue` array is that if inside the callback function `clearInterval()` is called, the newly pushed callback function can be also deleted, so that the infinite loops can be prevented. While the `taskQueue` array is not empty, continue this process.

### Solution

```js
class FakeTimer {
  constructor() {
    this.origSetInterval = window.setInterval;
    this.origClearInterval = window.clearInterval;
    this.origDateNow = Date.now;

    this.taskQueue = [];
    this.currTime = 0;
  }

  install() {
    window.setInterval = (fn, delay) => {
      const id = this.taskQueue.length;
      this.taskQueue.push({
        id,
        fn,
        delay,
      });
      return id;
    };

    window.clearInterval = (id) => {
      this.taskQueue = this.taskQueue.filter((task) => task.id !== id);
    };

    Date.now = () => this.currTime;
  }

  uninstall() {
    window.setInterval = this.origSetInterval;
    window.clearInterval = this.origClearInterval;
    Date.now = this.origDateNow;
  }

  tick() {
    while (this.taskQueue.length > 0) {
      const task = this.taskQueue.shift();
      this.currTime = task.delay;
      this.taskQueue.push({
        ...task,
        delay: this.currTime + task.delay,
      });
      task.fn();
    }
  }
}
```
