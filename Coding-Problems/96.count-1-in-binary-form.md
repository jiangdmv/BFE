#

### Problem Description

Given an integer, count "1" in its binary form.

```js
countOne(1); // 1,  "1"
countOne(257799); // 12, "111110111100000111"
```

1. If you use built-in string methods in JavaScript, please do understand the time complexity, they are not free.
2. Actually this could be easily done by counting the digit one by one. Could you think of some other approaches?

#

### Solution

```js
/**
 * @param {number} num - integer
 * @return {number} count of 1 bit
 */
function countOne(num) {
  return num.toString(2).replace(/0/g, '').length;
}
```

#

### Solution with Bitwise Operator

```js
/**
 * @param {number} num - integer
 * @return {number} count of 1 bit
 */
function countOne(num) {
  let count = 0;
  while (num) {
    num &= num - 1;
    count++;
  }
  return count;
}
```
