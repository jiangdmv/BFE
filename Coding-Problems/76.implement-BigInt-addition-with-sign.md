### Problem Description

This is a follow-up on [62. implement BigInt addition](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/add-BigInt-string).

You are asked to implement a string addition function, **with possible negative integers**. Also, '+' plus sign should also be supported

```js
add('-999999999999999999', '-1');
// '-1000000000000000000'

add('-999999999999999999', '+1');
// '-999999999999999998'
```

Don't use BigInt directly, it is not our goal here.

#

### Understanding the problem

I am asked to write a function that can perform string addition. It should work for both positive and negative integers and also support `'+'` plus sign, such as `'+1'`. I can't use the data type `BigInt`.

#

### Approach

I can solve the problem by 'adding' these two strings digit by digit.

- Check the sign of both numbers to find out if I should add these two strings or subtract them. If it is subtraction, compare the length of the two strings to figure out which string is going to be the minuend. If the second string is longer than the first string, set the second string as the first string, meaning the second string would be minuend and the first string becomes subtrahend; if their length is the same, start compare the first digits of the strings to figure out which one should be the minuend, if they are equal to each other, compare the 'digits' thereafter until two digits that are not equal are encountered. If the end of both strings is reached, return `'0'`. I would also store whether the first number is negative. Remove the sign from the both inputs.
- Initialize two pointers that are going to keep track of the position we are at in the two strings respectively. Initially, point both pointers to the end of the strings. I would call them `num1Idx` and `num2Idx`.
- Initialize a variable that is going to keep track of the carry/borrow from each arithmetic operation.
- Create an empty array to store the results of each arithmetic operation.
- Loop over each 'digit' in both strings until the end of both strings is reached.
  - Get the 'digits' the two pointers point at. If one of the digit is `undefined`, set it to `0`. Convert both digits to numbers. Add carry/borrow from the last iteration to the digit that is from the first string.
  - If I need to subtract these two strings, compare the digit from the first string to the digit from the second string. If the digit from the first string is smaller, then add 10 to it, and set carry/borrow to -1; otherwise set carry/borrow to 0. Subtract these two digits and append the result to the array of results.
  - If the arithmetic operation is addition, add these two digits. If the sum is greater than 10, set carry/borrow to 1, otherwise set it to 0. Append the ones-digit of the sum to the result.
- If I get out of the loop, and the carry is not 0, append the carry to the array of results. Suppose the numbers are `'99'` and `'1'`, after the loop, the array of results is going to be `[0, 0]`, and the carry is going to be `1`, therefore the carry also needs to be added into the array.
- Remove the leading 0s from the result.
  - Loop over the array of results starting from the end of the array. Every time I encounter a `0`, drop it. Loop until I get to a number that is not `0` for the first time or there is only one number left in the array.
- Reverse the array of results and convert it to a string. If the first string is negative, insert `'-'` at the beginning of the string. Return the string.

### Solution

```js
/**
 * @param {string} num1
 * @param {string} num2
 * @return {string}
 */
function add(num1, num2) {
  const operationInfo = detectOperationAndRemoveSign(num1, num2);
  if (!operationInfo) return '0';

  let { operation, firstNum, secondNum, isFirstNumNegative } = operationInfo;

  let idx1 = firstNum.length - 1;
  let idx2 = secondNum.length - 1;
  let carry = 0;
  const results = [];

  while (idx1 >= 0 || idx2 >= 0) {
    const digit1 = Number(firstNum[idx1] || 0) + carry;
    const digit2 = Number(secondNum[idx2] || 0);
    let result;

    if (operation === 'subtraction') {
      result = subtractDigits(digit1, digit2);
    } else {
      result = addDigits(digit1, digit2);
    }

    carry = result.carry;
    results.push(result.onesDigit);

    idx1--;
    idx2--;
  }

  if (carry > 0) results.push(carry);

  while (results[results.length - 1] === 0 && results.length > 1) {
    results.pop();
  }

  let resultStr = results.reverse().join('');
  return isFirstNumNegative ? '-' + resultStr : resultStr;
}

function detectOperationAndRemoveSign(num1, num2) {
  const num1StartsWithSign = isNaN(num1[0]);
  const num2StartsWithSign = isNaN(num2[0]);
  const signOfNum1 = num1StartsWithSign ? num1[0] : '+';
  const signOfNum2 = num2StartsWithSign ? num2[0] : '+';

  let firstNum = num1StartsWithSign ? num1.slice(1) : num1;
  let secondNum = num2StartsWithSign ? num2.slice(1) : num2;

  if (signOfNum1 === signOfNum2) {
    return {
      operation: 'addition',
      firstNum,
      secondNum,
      isFirstNumNegative: signOfNum1 === '-',
    };
  }

  if (firstNum.length > secondNum.length) {
    return {
      operation: 'subtraction',
      firstNum,
      secondNum,
      isFirstNumNegative: signOfNum1 === '-',
    };
  }

  if (firstNum.length < secondNum.length) {
    return {
      operation: 'subtraction',
      firstNum: secondNum,
      secondNum: firstNum,
      isFirstNumNegative: signOfNum2 === '-',
    };
  }

  for (let idx = 0; idx < firstNum.length; idx++) {
    const digit1 = Number(firstNum[idx]);
    const digit2 = Number(secondNum[idx]);
    if (digit1 > digit2) {
      break;
    }

    if (digit1 < digit2) {
      const temp = firstNum;
      firstNum = secondNum;
      secondNum = temp;
      signOfNum1 = signOfNum2;
      break;
    }

    if (idx === firstNum.length - 1) return null;
  }

  return {
    operation: 'subtraction',
    firstNum,
    secondNum,
    isFirstNumNegative: signOfNum1 === '-',
  };
}

function subtractDigits(digit1, digit2) {
  let carry = 0;

  if (digit1 < digit2) {
    carry = -1;
    digit1 += 10;
  }

  return { onesDigit: digit1 - digit2, carry };
}

function addDigits(digit1, digit2) {
  const sum = digit1 + digit2;
  return { onesDigit: sum % 10, carry: sum >= 10 ? 1 : 0 };
}
```
