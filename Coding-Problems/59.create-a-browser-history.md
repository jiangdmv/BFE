#

### Problem Description

I believe you are very familiar about your browser you are currently visiting https://bigfrontend.dev with.

The common actions relating to history are:

1. `new BrowserHistory()` - when you open a new tab, it is set with an empty history
2. `goBack()` - go to last entry, notice the entries are kept so that forward() could get us back
3. `forward()` - go to next visited entry
4. `visit()` - when you enter a new address or click a link, this adds a new entry but truncate the entries which we could `forward()` to.

Say we start a new tab, this is the empty history.

```
[ ]
```

Then visit url A, B, C in turn.

```
[ A, B, C]
        ↑
```

We are currently at C, we could `goBack()` to B, then to A

```
[ A, B, C]
  ↑
```

`forward()` get us to B

```
[ A, B, C]
     ↑
```

Now if we visit a new url D, since we are currently at B, C is truncated.

```
[ A, B, D]
        ↑
```

You are asked to implement a `BrowserHistory` class to mimic the behavior.

### Solution

```js
class BrowserHistory {
  /**
   * @param {string} url
   * if url is set, it means new tab with url
   * otherwise, it is empty new tab
   */
  constructor(url) {
    // Store the url, since the method `goBack()` should
    // return the initial url if it is out of bounds.
    /** For instance,
     *  const bh = new BrowserHistory('X')
     *  bh.visit('A')
     *  bh.goBack()
     *  bh.goBack()
     *  console.log(bh.current); // should be be 'X' rather than undefined.
     */
    this.initialUrl = url;
    this.urls = url ? [url] : [];
    this.currentIndex = this.urls.length - 1;
  }
  /**
   * @param { string } url
   */
  visit(url) {
    this.currentIndex++;
    this.urls[this.currentIndex] = url;
  }

  /**
   * @return {string} current url
   */
  get current() {
    return this.currentIndex >= 0
      ? this.urls[this.currentIndex]
      : this.initialUrl;
  }

  // go to previous entry
  goBack() {
    this.currentIndex--;
  }

  // go to next visited url
  forward() {
    this.currentIndex = Math.min(this.urls.length - 1, this.currentIndex + 1);
  }
}
```
