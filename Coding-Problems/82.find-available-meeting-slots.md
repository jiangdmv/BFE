# 82. find available meeting slots

### Problem

https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/find-available-meeting-slots

#

### Problem Description

`[start, end]` is a time interval, with all integers from 0 to 24.

Given schedules for all team members,

<!--prettier-ignore-->
```js
[
  [[13, 15], [11, 12], [10, 13]], //schedule for member 1
  [[8, 9]], // schedule for member 2
  [[13, 18]] // schedule for member 3
]
```

You need to create a function `findMeetingSlots()` to return the time slots available for all the members to have a meeting.

For the input above, below slots should be returned

<!--prettier-ignore-->
```js
[[0, 8],[9, 10],[18, 24]]
```

**Notes**

1. the input schedule intervals might be unsorted
2. one member's schedule might have overlapping intervals.

#

### Understanding the problem

I am given an array of schedules for team members. Each schedule is an array of time blocks, which are in the form of `[start, end]`, and both `start` and `end` are integers from 0 to 24. I am asked to write a function that is going to return an array of all the time blocks during which all the team members can have a meeting. The schedules might not be sorted by the start time and they might have overlapping time blocks.

#

### Approach

To solve the problem I would first merge the schedules for the team members into one array and sorted the array by start time in ascending order, so that I can find the time blocks available for all team members. Then I would initialize an empty array that is going to store the available time blocks and a variable called `currentEndTime` that is going to keep track of the current end time to handle the overlapping time blocks; initially, set it to `0`. I will loop through the sorted array of time blocks. At each time block, I am going to compare its start time to the `currentEndTime`, if it is greater than the `currentEndTime`, then it means I have found a available time block, where the start time is `currentEndTime` and the end time is the start time of the current time block; otherwise, compare the `currentEndTime` to the end time of the current time block, if it is smaller than the end time, update `currentEndTime` to the end time of the current time block. When I get out of the loop, compare the `currentEndTime` to `24`, if it is smaller than `24`, push the time block that starts at `currentEndTime` and ends at ``24` to the array of available time blocks. Finally, return the array of available time blocks.

### Time & Space Complexity

O(nlog(n)) - time | O(n) space, where n is total number of time blocks(time intervals) in the input array.

### Solution

```js
// type Interval = [number, number]

/**
 * @param {Interval[][]} schedules
 * @return {Interval[]}
 */
function findMeetingSlots(schedules) {
  const mergedSchedules = mergeSchedules(schedules);
  mergedSchedules.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

  const availableTimeBlocks = [];
  let currentEndTime = 0;

  for (const timeBlock of mergedSchedules) {
    const [startTime, endTime] = timeBlock;

    if (startTime > currentEndTime) {
      availableTimeBlocks.push([currentEndTime, startTime]);
    }

    if (endTime > currentEndTime) {
      currentEndTime = endTime;
    }
  }

  if (currentEndTime < 24) {
    availableTimeBlocks.push([currentEndTime, 24]);
  }

  return availableTimeBlocks;
}

function mergeSchedules(schedules) {
  const mergedSchedules = [];
  for (const schedule of schedules) {
    mergedSchedules.push(...schedule);
  }
  return mergedSchedules;
}
```

#

### Approach without Sorting

Instead of merging the schedules into one array and then sorting it, I could create an array of hours where the indices are every hour of the day and the values are going to be 0, then I am going to loop through the input array and store start times and end times into the array of hours: for the start time I will increase the value at that hour by 1 and for the end time I will decrease the value by 1, so that I can differentiate start time from end time in the array of hours. For instance, if the schedules are: `[[13, 15], [11, 12], [10, 13]]`, `[[8, 9]]` and `[[13, 18]]`, the array of hours is going to be:

<!--prettier-ignore-->
```js
// 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24
[  0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, -1, 1,  1, -1,  1,  0, -1,  0,  0, -1,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0, 0 ]
```

If the schedules are `[[9, 10], [12, 13], [16, 18]]` and `[[10, 11], [12, 14], [14, 15], [16, 17]]`, the array of hours is going to be:

<!--prettier-ignore-->
```js
// 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24
[  0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1,  0, -1,  2, -1,  0, -1,  2, -1, -1,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0, 0 ]
```

I can then initialize a variable called `busyTimeBlockCounter` that is going to keep track of the time block, initially set it to 0. From the arrays of hours, I can notice that if I loop though the array of hours and add each value in the array of hours to `busyTimeBlockCounter`, when I get to a value that is equal to or greater than `1` and `busyTimeBlockCounter` is equal to `0`, then I have found an available time block:

```
  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24
[ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, -1, 1,  1, -1,  1,  0, -1,  0,  0, -1,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0, 0 ]
                          ^
                          i

busyTimeBlockCounter:  2 - 1 - 1 = 0;
available time blocks: [0, 8], [9, 10], [18, 24]
```

So I also need to initialize a variable that is going to keep track of the start time of a available time block; initially set it to `0`. While going through the array of hours, if I get to a value that is not `0` and after adding it to `busyTimeBlockCounter`, `busyTimeBlockCounter` becomes `0`, then the index that the value is at is the start time of a available time block.

When I get out of the loop and the start time of a available time block is less than `24`, then it means a time block that starts at that time and ends at `24` is available for all team members.

Since I don't need to sort the array, I get the time complexity down to linear time from nlog(n).

Inspired by [this solution](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/82/discuss/919).

### Time & Space Complexity

O(n) time | O(n) space, where n is total number of time blocks(time intervals) in the input array.

### Solution without Sorting

```js
// type Interval = [number, number]

// 0, 1, 2, ... , 24.
const NUM_OF_HOURS = 25;

/**
 * @param {Interval[][]} schedules
 * @return {Interval[]}
 */
function findMeetingSlots(schedules) {
  const busyHours = generateBusyHours(schedules);

  const availableTimeBlocks = [];
  let availableStartTime = 0;
  let busyTimeBlockCounter = 0;

  for (let currentHour = 0; currentHour < NUM_OF_HOURS; currentHour++) {
    const isStartTime = busyHours[currentHour] > 0;
    const isNewBusyTimeBlock = isStartTime && busyTimeBlockCounter === 0;
    if (isNewBusyTimeBlock && currentHour !== 0) {
      availableTimeBlocks.push([availableStartTime, currentHour]);
    }

    busyTimeBlockCounter += busyHours[currentHour];

    const isEndTime = busyHours[currentHour] < 0;
    const isNewAvailableStartTime = isEndTime && busyTimeBlockCounter === 0;
    if (isNewAvailableStartTime) {
      availableStartTime = currentHour;
    }
  }

  if (availableStartTime < 24) {
    availableTimeBlocks.push([availableStartTime, 24]);
  }

  return availableTimeBlocks;
}

function generateBusyHours(schedules) {
  const busyHours = Array(NUM_OF_HOURS).fill(0);
  for (const schedule of schedules) {
    for (const [startTime, endTime] of schedule) {
      busyHours[startTime]++;
      busyHours[endTime]--;
    }
  }
  return busyHours;
}
```
