# 72. implement Observable interval()

#

### Problem Description

This is a follow-up on [57. create an Observable](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/create-an-Observable).

Suppose you have solved [57. create an Observable](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/create-an-Observable), here you are asked to implement a creation operator `interval()`.

From the [document](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/api/index/function/interval), `interval()`

> Creates an Observable that emits sequential numbers every specified interval of time

```js
interval(1000).subscribe(console.log);
```

Above code prints 0, 1, 2 .... with an interval of 1 seconds.

**Note** Observable is already given for you, no need to create it.

#

### Understanding the problem

I am asked to write a function called `interval(period)`. The function should create an Observable that will emit an infinite sequence of ascending integers, starting from 0, every specified interval of time. The class `Observable` is provided to me.

#

### Approach

To create a Observable, I need to provide a callback as setup to the new `Observable` constructor, such as:

```js
const observable = new Observable((subscriber) => {
  subscriber.next(1);
  subscriber.next(2);
  setTimeout(() => {
    subscriber.next(3);
    subscriber.next(4);
    subscriber.complete();
  }, 100);
});
```

And in order to emit an infinite sequence of ascending integers, I can initialize a variable that is going to store the current integer.

### Solution

```js
/**
 * @param {number} period
 * @return {Observable}
 */
function interval(period) {
  let num = 0;
  return new Observable((subscriber) => {
    setInterval(() => {
      // subscriber.next(num++);
      subscriber.next(num);
      num++;
    }, period);
  });
}
```
