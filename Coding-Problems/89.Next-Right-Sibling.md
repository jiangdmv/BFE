# 89. Next Right Sibling

### Problem

https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/Next-Right-Sibiling

#

### Problem Description

Given a DOM tree and a target element, please return the **next right sibling**.

![A DOM tree](https://i.imgur.com/DUICfa3.png 'A DOM tree')

Like above, the next right sibling of `<button/>` is the blue `<a/>`. Notice that **they don't necessarily have the same parent element**.

If no right sibling, then return `null`.

What is time & space cost of your solution ?

#

### Understanding the problem

I am given a DOM tree and a target element. I am tasked with finding the right sibling of the target element. The target element and its right sibling don't necessarily have the same parent element. If right sibling doesn't exit, return `null`.

#

### Approach with BFS

We could solve this problem with iterative Breadth First Search. With Breadth First Search, the element to right of the target element in the queue is either the right sibling or the first element in the next tree level. We can use `null` values as indication that we reach the end of a level. At the very beginning of our function, we initialize a queue and enqueue the root node into it. In addition, we also enqueue `null` into the queue, since there is only node in the first tree level. When we traverse the DOM tree, dequeue node out of the queue, and if we come across a `null` value, then we know we are at the end of a level, so we enqueue a `null` value into the queue to indicate the end of the next level.
For instance, imagine we have the following DOM tree:

```
                    <div/>
                  /    \    \
            <div/>   <div/>  <div/>
            /    \       \      \
          <p/>   <p/>    <p/>   <p/>
          /      /
        <a/>    <a/>
```

At the very beginning, we enqueue `<div/>` and `null` into the queue.

```
[<div/>, null];
```

We dequeue `<div/>` out of the queue, and push its child nodes into the queue.

```
[null, <div/>, <div/>, <div/>];
```

We dequeue the first element out of the queue again. Since it's `null`, we know we are at the end of the first level. Since there is no more node to explore in the current level, there is no more child node in the second level that we need to enqueue into the queue. So we enqueue `null` into the queue.

```
[<div/>, <div/>, <div/>, null];
```

We keep doing the same process until we get to the target element or there is no more node to explore. If it is the former case, we return the element at the front of the queue; otherwise return `null`.

### Solution

```js
/**
 * @param {HTMLElement} root
 * @param {HTMLElement} target
 * @return {HTMLElement | null}
 */
function nextRightSibling(root, target) {
  const queue = [root, null];

  while (queue.length > 0) {
    const node = queue.shift();

    if (node === target) {
      return queue[0];
    }

    if (node === null) {
      queue.push(null);
    } else {
      queue.push(...node.children);
    }
  }

  return null;
}
```

### Approach with DOM API

### Solution

```js
/**
 * @param {HTMLElement} root
 * @param {HTMLElement} target
 * @return {HTMLElement | null}
 */
function nextRightSibling(root, target) {
  if (!target) return null;
  if (target.nextElementSibling) {
    return target.nextElementSibling;
  }

  let parent = target.parentElement;
  let parentNextSibling = nextRightSibling(root, parent);
  while (parentNextSibling) {
    if (parentNextSibling && parentNextSibling.firstElementChild) {
      return parentNextSibling.firstElementChild;
    }
    parentNextSibling = nextRightSibling(root, parentNextSibling);
  }

  return null;
}
```
