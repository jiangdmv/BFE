this behaves differently in different situations, you should clearly list up all the cases, from common cases to rare ones.

### Solution

### What is `this` ?

In JavaScript, the `this` keyword refers to an <b>object</b>.
Which object depends on how `this` is being used.

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>In an objet method, `this` refers to the <b>object.</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Alone, `this` refers to the <b>global object.</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>In a function, `this` refers to the <b>global object.</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>In a function, in strict mode, `this` is <b>undefined.</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>In an event, `this` refers to the <b>element</b> that received the event.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer `this` to  <b>any object.</b></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

##

#### - `this` in a Method

When used in an object method, `this` refers to the object.

```js
let person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  fullName() {
    //this refers to person
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  },
};
```

#### - `this` Alone

When used alone, `this` refers to the global object, cuz `this` is running in the global scope. In a browser window the global object is `Window`

```js
//this refers to the global object
let x = this;
```

In <b>strict mode</b>, when used alone, `this` also refers to global object.

```js
//this refers to the global object
"use strict";
let x = this;
```

#### - `this` in a function

In a function, the global object is the default binding for `this`. In a browser window the global object is `Window`.

```js
//this refers to the global object by default
function myFunction() {
  return this;
}
```

In <b>strict mode</b>, when used in a function, `this` is `undefined`.

```js
//In strict mode, when used in a function, this is undefined
"use strict";
function myFunction() {
  return this;
}
```
