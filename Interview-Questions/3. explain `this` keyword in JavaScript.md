#

### Problem Description

this behaves differently in different situations, you should clearly list up all the cases, from common cases to rare ones.

if you are not familiar with it yet, please read this article from MDN first.

It would help if you clearly state the case of Arrow Function

#

### Solution

this keyword refers to the owner of the function we executing - the object that a function is a method of

arrow function don't have this keyworkd

this changes depending on how the function is callled, this is determined at invocation time

if the function is called as raw function (just myFunc()), then this will be global object or window in browser or undefined in strict mode if it's called as method of an object - then this is assigned to that object

if you call function with call or apply - this is determined by first argument

on event listener - it will be the target of the event

if its called as a constructor with new, this will be a newly-created object whose prototype is set to prototype property of the constructor function

if the function is the result of bind operation, that function will always and forever have 'this' set to the first argument of the bind call that produced it, this is a single exception when we have fixed 'this' - function produces with bind have immutable 'this'
