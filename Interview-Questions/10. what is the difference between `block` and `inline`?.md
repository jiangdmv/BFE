### Problem Description

Seems to be an easy one, but even for the simplest question we could do our best to shine.

To answer this question, maybe we could mention Normal Flow(CSS Flow Layout) and Formatting Context

#

### Solution

1. Displays an element as an inline element. Any height and width properties will have no effect.

```css
.inline-element {
  display: inline;
  width: 1000px; /* ❌ won't have any effect */
  height: 1000px; /* ❌ won't have any effect */
}
```

Inline elements:
Here are a few elements that have a default inline property:

span
a
img

And most of the formatting tags are also are inherently inline:

em
strong
i
small

2. Displays an element as an inline-level block container. You CAN set height and width values.

Alright, let's move on to inline-block. It’s essentially the same thing as inline, except that you can set height and width values.

```css
.inline-block-element {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 1000px; /* ✅  yes, it will work */
  height: 1000px; /* ✅  yes, it will work */
}
```

3. block starts on a NEW line and takes up the full width available. So that means block elements will occupy the entire width of its parent element.

block elements
Here are a few elements that have a default block property:

div
h1
p
li
section
