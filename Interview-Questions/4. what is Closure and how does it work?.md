### Problem Description

Closure is a common term in JavaScript.

The definition is easy, but you should explain well on details about how closure works.

#

### Solution

#### 1. What is `Closure`?

In one word, `closure` means that an inner function always has access to the variables of its outer function. For example,

```js
//outer function add
function add() {
  let counter = 0;
  //inner function plus
  function plus() {
    counter += 1;
  }
  plus();
  return counter;
}
add(); // 1
```

Inner function plus has access to its outer function add's variable counter. It changed counter's value from 0 to 1.

##### -Why do we need `closure`?

Sometimes we want to access a variable or function outside of the function scope but we don't want to make it a global. In this case, `closure` can be useful to create private variables or functions.

#### 2. How does `Closure` work?

We can create a function with variables and a inner function, and return the inner function. Then define a variable globally equal to the outer function. The outer function's variables will become private variables.
For example, if we want to use a variable for counting something and increase it everytime we want. If we make this variable a global variable, then any code can change this variable. We should make this variable a private variable and increase it everytime by excuting a function.

```js
const add = (function () {
  let counter = 0;
  return function () {
    counter += 1;
    return counter;
  };
})();
add(); //1
add(); //2
add(); //3
```
