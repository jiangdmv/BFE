# 5.`var` vs `let` vs `const`

### Problem

https://bigfrontend.dev/question/var-vs-let-vs-const

#

### Problem Description

The biggest difference is about the variable scope, so you should understand it first.

Before you start explaining the difference, it is recommended to talk about your general rule on which to use in common cases.

Then you can start talking about the technical difference between var, let and const

#

### Solution

#### `var` keyword

Scope of `var`: Global scoped or function scoped.

```js
// a is declared globally, so the scope of the variable 'a' is global, and it can be accessible everywhere in the program.
var a = 10;
function func() {
  console.log(a); //10
}
console.log(a); //10
```

```js
// a is declared inside the function. If the user tries to access it outside the function, it will display the error.
function func() {
  var a = 10;
  console.log(a);
}
func(); //10
console.log(a); //ReferenceError: a is not defined
```

`var` variables can be re-declared and updated

```js
//var variables can be re-declared
var a = 10;
var a = 8;
```

```js
//var variables can be updated
var a = 10;
a = 8;
```

`var` variables can be hoisted -- hoisting is a behavior of moving declarations to the top. It means a variable can be used before it has been declared.

```js
a = 10;
console.log(a); //10
var a;
```

If users use the var variable before the declaration, it initializes with the `undefined` value.

```js
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;
```

#### `let` keyword

The `let` keyword is an improved version of the `var` keyword.
Scope of `let`: Blocked scoped -- A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly braces. Anything within curly braces is a block.

```js
// a is declared globally, so a can be accessed in func.
let a = 10;
function func() {
  // b is declared in func block, so b can be accessed in func.
  let b = 9;
  console.log(a); //10
  console.log(b); //9
}
// b is declared in func block, so b can't be accessed outside of the block scope
console.log(b); //ReferenceError: b is not defined
```

`let` variables can be updated but not re-declared

```js
let a = 10;
a = 8; // 6
let a = 8; // SyntaxError: Indentifier 'a' has already been declared
```

`let` variables can be re-declared in different blocks, cuz it's block scoped

```js
let a = 10;
if (true) {
  let a = 9;
  console.log(a); //9
}
console.log(a); //10
```

`let` variables cannot be hoisted

```js
console.log(a); // ReferenceError: Cannot access a before initialization
let a = 10;
```

#### `const` keyword

`const` keyword has all the properties that are the same as the `let` keyword, except the user cannot update it.

```js
const a = 10;
function func() {
  const a = 9;
  console.log(a);
}
func(); //9
const a = 9; //SnytaxError: Identifier a has already been declared
```

`const` variables cannot be hoisted
