# 5.`var` vs `let` vs `const`

### Problem

https://bigfrontend.dev/question/var-vs-let-vs-const

#

### Problem Description

The biggest difference is about the variable scope, so you should understand it first.

Before you start explaining the difference, it is recommended to talk about your general rule on which to use in common cases.

Then you can start talking about the technical difference between var, let and const

#

### Solution

Var has Hoisting.

Var is global variable.

Let and Const do not have Hoisting.

Let and Const are local variable.

Const cannot be modified.

`let` variables can be re-declared in different blocks, cuz it's block scoped

```js
let a = 10;
if (true) {
  let a = 9;
  console.log(a); //9
}
console.log(a); //10
```

`let` variables cannot be hoisted

```js
console.log(a); // ReferenceError: Cannot access a before initialization
let a = 10;
```
