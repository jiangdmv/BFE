#

### Problem Description

A not-that-easy question.

Suppose you you a 5-year-old, what do you like the most and try to bind some Promise concept on that.

Do mention all the good stuff on Promise, like thenable, resolve/reject, error catching .etc

#

### Solution

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise

The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

A promise means give you a result for sure.

```js
let p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    let a = 1+1
    if (a==2) {
        resolve('Success)
    } else {
        reject('Failed')
    }
})

p.then((message) => {
    console.log('This is in the then ' + message)
}).catch((message) => {
    console.log('This is in the catch ' + message)
})

// here is another example

Promise.all([
    recordVideoOne,
    recordVideoTwo,
    recordVideoThree
]).then((messages) => {
    console.log(messagesa)
})
```

Here is another example

The Javascript Promise:

A Promise is a "proxy for a value that will eventually become available." I think of it as an operation that has already started but hasn't necessarily completed yet. When incomplete, the Promise is considered to be in a "pending" state. When completed, the Promise progresses to the "resolved" state.

For example, the Fetch API returns a Promise to retrieve data from a URL:

```js
const url = "https://example.com";
fetch(url)
  .then((response) => console.log(response))
  .catch((error) => console.log(error));
console.log(url);
```

The Python Awaitable:

Python has many async objects that inherit the Awaitable interface, but the three main ones are coroutines, Tasks, and Futures. Of these, the Task is most similar to the Javascript Promise.

Let's take the same Javascript snippet from before and translate it to Python:

```python
from asyncio import create_task

async def fetch(url):
	# Fetch data asynchronously from a URL
    pass

url = "https://example.com"
task = create_task(fetch(url))
print(url)
try:
    response = await task
    print(response)
except Exception as exc:
    print(exc)
```
