# 2. What is Prototypal Inheritance? How does it work?

### Problem

https://bigfrontend.dev/question/what-is-prototypal-inheritance-how-does-it-work

#

### Problem Description

It is hard to explain something clearly. I'd suggest you take a top-down approach for this kind of abstract concept.

for example.

generally what it is
what does it consist of , how does it work
what can we gain by using it
what we need to pay attention to .
....
If you are not familiar with Prototype, I recommend you first thoroughly read this article from JavaScript.info.

Good Luck!

### Solution

Object Orientation

```js
class Shoe {
  constructor(size, color, material) {
    this.size = size;
    this.color = color;
    this.material = material;
  }

  changeColor(newColor) {
    return (this.color = newColor);
  }

  wearDown() {
    return this.size--;
  }
}
```

Classical Inheritance:

We can only refer to Objects through Classes. Classes are a Generalization of an object.

```js
class Shoe {
    ...
}

class Boot extends Shoe {
    ...
}

let hikingShoe = new Boot();
```

Prototypal Inheritance:

As opposed to Classical Inheritance, Prototypal Inheritance does not deal with increasing layers of abstraction. An Object is either an abstraction of a real-word thing, same as before, or is a direct copy of another Object (in other words, a Prototype). Objects can be created from thin air, or they can be created from other objects.

```js
const shoe = {};

const boot = Object.create(shoe);

const hikingShoe = Object.create(boot);
```

This is important! It means that Generalizations (like the overarching Shoe concept) are just other Objects. With Classical Inheritance, Generalizations are abstractions of abstractions of abstractions... all the way down to the most recent descendant.

The abstraction level here is never deeper than 1; The only abstraction that occurs with Prototypal Inheritance is the abstraction away from real-world things.

Prototypal Inheritance includes some key advantages over Classical Inheritance:

The Mechanics of Prototypal Inheritance:

The Constructor:

In JavaScript, all Objects have a Constructor. And in JavaScript classes, we use the Constructor function to create and instantiate new Objects within a class. Each class can only have one constructor. In the example above, we instantiate each Shoe Object with characteristics that all Shoe Objects share (all Shoes have a size, color, and material).

You can take a more in-depth look into Constructors (how to view an Object's class, how to change a class, etc.) on MDN.

New Operator:

According to MDN docs the New operator performs the following actions:

1. Creates a blank, plain JavaScript object;
2. Links (sets the constructor of) this object to another object;
3. Passes the newly created object from Step 1 as the this context;
4. Returns this if the function doesn't return its own object.

In order to instantiate a Prototype of a JS class, we use the keyword new. In the example above, we define the name of the new Object let slipper and create it with new. We then pass in the parameters defined in the constructor of the Shoe class. These new Object instantiations are known as types. You can then access any of the Object properties by calling, for example, slipper.size or slipper.color.

```js
class Shoe {
    constructor(size, color, material) {
        this.size = size;
        this.color = color;
        this.material = material;
    }
}

slipper = new Shoe{12, 'green', 'rubber'};
```

1. generally what it is?

2. what does it consist of , how does it work

3. what can we gain by using it

4. what we need to pay attention to .
