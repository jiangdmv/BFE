# 28. How to detect crash of a web page?

### Problem Description

A very interesting question. onbeforeunload could be used to let us know right before a page is unloaded.

But if the web page crashes, the JavaScript doesn't even have chance to run.

So how could we know that a web page crashed because of unexpected reasons?

The onbeforeunload event occurs when the document is about to be unloaded.

This event allows you to display a message in a confirmation dialog box to inform the user whether he/she wants to stay or leave the current page.

The default message that appears in the confirmation box, is different in different browsers. However, the standard message is something like "Are you sure you want to leave this page?". This message cannot be removed.

However, you can write a custom message together with the default message. See the first example on this page. Note: This only works in Internet Explorer.

Note: If the onbeforeunload event is not assigned to the <body> element, you must assign/attach the event on the window object, and use the returnValue property to create a custom message (see syntax examples below).

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body onbeforeunload="return myFunction()">
    <p>
      This example demonstrates how to assign an "onbeforeunload" event to a
      body element.
