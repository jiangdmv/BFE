### Problem Description

Closure is a common term in JavaScript.

The definition is easy, but you should explain well on details about how closure works.

#

### Solution

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures

A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. 

In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.

```js
const add = (function () {
  let counter = 0;
  return function () {
    counter += 1;
    return counter;
  };
})();

add();
add();
add();

// the counter is now 3
```

Example Explained

The variable add is assigned to the return value of a self-invoking function.

The self-invoking function only runs once. It sets the counter to zero (0), and returns a function expression.

This way add becomes a function. The "wonderful" part is that it can access the counter in the parent scope.

This is called a JavaScript closure. It makes it possible for a function to have "private" variables.

The counter is protected by the scope of the anonymous function, and can only be changed using the add function.
