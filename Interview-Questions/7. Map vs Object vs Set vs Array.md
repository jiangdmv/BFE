# 7. Map vs Object vs Set vs Array

### Problem

https://bigfrontend.dev/question/Map-vs-Object-vs-Set-vs-Array

#

### Problem Description

To explain the differences, first you need to tell what each is for and how they work.

Then you can call talk about capability difference between Array vs Object, Array vs Set, Map vs Object.

One important thing is performance, which again Prototype comes around, please do mention that

### Solution

map - similar to obeject, but can have objects as keys, when passing object as key to object it will get converted to ['object': Object] , guarantees order of elements to be in insertion order.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map

```js
const map1 = new Map();

map1.set("a", 1);
map1.set("b", 2);
map1.set("c", 3);
//The set() method adds or updates an element with a specified key and a value to a Map object.
//set(key, value)

console.log(map1.get("a"));
// expected output: 1

map1.set("a", 97);

console.log(map1.get("a"));
// expected output: 97

console.log(map1.size);
// expected output: 3

map1.delete("b");

console.log(map1.size);
// expected output: 2
```

object- holds key value pair, lookup is quick O(1), since es2015 - stores entries in insertion order but except if the key is a number, to calculate size we need to use Object(obj).keys().length

set - kind of like array, but hold only unique values, so if you pass duplicates it will save just one of them, often use to remove duplicates - look up can be more efficient than normal arrays.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set

```js
const mySet1 = new Set();

mySet1.add(1); // Set [ 1 ]
mySet1.add(5); // Set [ 1, 5 ]
mySet1.add(5); // Set [ 1, 5 ]
mySet1.add("some text"); // Set [ 1, 5, 'some text' ]
const o = { a: 1, b: 2 };
mySet1.add(o);

mySet1.add({ a: 1, b: 2 }); // o is referencing a different object, so this is okay

mySet1.has(1); // true
mySet1.has(3); // false, since 3 has not been added to the set
mySet1.has(5); // true
mySet1.has(Math.sqrt(25)); // true
mySet1.has("Some Text".toLowerCase()); // true
mySet1.has(o); // true

mySet1.size; // 5

mySet1.delete(5); // removes 5 from the set
mySet1.has(5); // false, 5 has been removed

mySet1.size; // 4, since we just removed one value

console.log(mySet1);
// logs Set(4) [ 1, "some text", {…}, {…} ] in Firefox
// logs Set(4) { 1, "some text", {…}, {…} } in Chrome
```

array - holds list of values - expensive lookup as need to itereta through the array - O(n)

weak maps - keys need to be objects, helps to improve for performance, because then javascript engine can garbage collect what's not used, because of that it also doesnt have .size and it's not iterable weak set - elements need to be object, also used for performance improvements, don't have size like a normal set and it's not iterable
