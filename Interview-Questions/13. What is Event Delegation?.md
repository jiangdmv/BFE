### Problem Description

Event Delegation is a common approach to avoid too many event listeners, which is used in jQuery and React.

Could you explain how Event Delegation work?

### Solution

https://javascript.info/event-delegation

Capturing and bubbling allow us to implement one of the most powerful event handling patterns called event delegation.

The idea is that if we have a lot of elements handled in a similar way, then instead of assigning a handler to each of them – we put a single handler on their common ancestor.

In the handler we get event.target to see where the event actually happened and handle it.

Example:

The table has 9 cells, but there could be 99 or 9999, doesn’t matter.

Our task is to highlight a cell <td> on click.

Instead of assign an onclick handler to each <td> (can be many) – we’ll setup the “catch-all” handler on <table> element.

It will use event.target to get the clicked element and highlight it.

```js
let selectedTd;

table.onclick = function (event) {
  let target = event.target; // where was the click?

  if (target.tagName != "TD") return; // not on TD? Then we're not interested

  highlight(target); // highlight it
};

function highlight(td) {
  if (selectedTd) {
    // remove the existing highlight if any
    selectedTd.classList.remove("highlight");
  }
  selectedTd = td;
  selectedTd.classList.add("highlight"); // highlight the new td
}
```
