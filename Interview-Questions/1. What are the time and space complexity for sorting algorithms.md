# 1. What are the time and space complexity for sorting algorithms

### Problem

https://bigfrontend.dev/question/what-are-the-time-and-space-complexity-for-main-sorting-algorithms

#

### Problem Description

FrontEnd engineer interviews are usually not about difficult algorithm problems. Yet still it is a must to comprehend the cost of common sorting algorithms.

First you should remember how many sorting algorithms are there, and how they work.

Then you should answer the average time/space complexity for each, and also the worst case for each.

Don't forget to mention the stability.

#

### Solution

Merge Sort n\*log(n) stable

Quick Sort n\*log(n) unstable

```js
/**
 * @param { Function } func
 */
function curry(func) {
  // Return a wrapper function to make it curry-able.
  return function curried(...args) {
    // If passed arguments count is greater than or equal to original function 'func'
    // parameters count, directly call 'func' with passed arguments.
    if (args.length >= func.length) {
      return func.apply(this, args);
    } else {
      // Otherwise return another wrapper function to gather new argument
      // and pass it to `curried` function. This will continue until
      // arguments count >= parameters count.
      return function (...args2) {
        return curried.apply(this, args.concat(args2));
      };
    }
  };
}
```
