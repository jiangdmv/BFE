# 38. implement Add<A, B>

### Problem

https://bigfrontend.dev/typescript/implement-Add-A-B

#

### Problem Description

Implement `Add<A, B>` to get the sum of two positive integers.

```ts
type A = Add<1, 2>; // 3
type B = Add<0, 0>; // 0
```

#

### Solution

```ts
type CreateTuple<
  S extends number,
  A extends number[] = []
> = A['length'] extends S ? A : CreateTuple<S, [...A, 1]>;

type Add<A extends number, B extends number> = [
  ...CreateTuple<A>,
  ...CreateTuple<B>
]['length'];
```

### Explanation

Since `A` and `B` are both non-negative number, to solve this problem, we can create two tuples whose length is going to be equal to `A` and `B` respectively, then we merge the two tuples into one and return the length of the merged tuple, which is the sum of `A` and `B`.
