# 45. implement Slice<A, S, E>

### Problem

https://bigfrontend.dev/typescript/Slice

#

### Problem Description

Just like what `Array.prototype.slice()` does, please implement `Slice<A, S, E>`.

```ts
type A = Slice<[1, 2, 3, 4], 0, 2>; // [1, 2]
type B = Slice<[1, 2, 3, 4], 2>; // [3, 4]
type C = Slice<[number, boolean, bigint], 2, 5>; // [bigint]
type D = Slice<[string, boolean], 0, 1>; // [string]
type E = Slice<[number, boolean, bigint], 5, 6>; // []
```

Let's assume end index `E` won't be negative

#

### Solution

```ts
type SmallerThan<
  X extends number,
  Y extends number,
  A extends any[] = []
> = A['length'] extends Y
  ? false
  : A['length'] extends X
  ? true
  : SmallerThan<X, Y, [...A, 1]>;

type Slice<
  A extends any[],
  S extends number = 0,
  E extends number = A['length'],
  I extends any[] = [],
  O extends any[] = []
> = A extends [infer F, ...infer R]
  ? SmallerThan<I['length'], S> extends false
    ? SmallerThan<I['length'], E> extends true
      ? Slice<R, S, E, [...I, 1], [...O, F]>
      : O
    : Slice<R, S, E, [...I, 1], O>
  : O;
```

### Explanation

To implement `Slice<A, S, E>`, we can keep track of the current index `I` we are at and compare it to the start index `S` and the end index `E`:

- If `I < S`, we remove the first element from the input array `A`, and increase `I` by `1`.

- If `I >= S` and `I < E`, we push the first element of `A` into our output array `O` and remove it from the input array `A`. Increase `I` by `1`.

- If `I >= E`, return the output array `O`.

Since in TypeScript there is no built-in arithmetical types, for instance, we cannot use `I + 1` to increase `I`, we will make use of `array['length']` to get the current index and increment it. We start with an empty array `I`, the length of `I` is `0`, so the current index is `0`. To increase the current index by `1`, we can push an arbitrary element into `I`.

In order to know whether the current index is within the range of `S` and `E`, we need to implement `SmallerThan<X, Y>`, which is going to return `true` if `X < Y` otherwise return `false`. Since, `X` and `Y` are both non-negative integers, we can implement `SmallerThan<X, Y>` with the help of `array['length']`.

We start with an empty array `A`:

- If `Y extends A['length']` returns `true`, then it means `Y = 0`. Since both `X` and `Y` are non-negative integers, `X` must be equal to or greater than `0`, hence is equal to or greater than `Y`, we return `false`.

- If `Y extends A['length']` returns `false`, it means `Y` is greater than `0`. We then check whether `X` is equal to `0`. If that is the case, then `Y` must be greater than `X`, we can return `true`.

- We are here because neither `X` nor `Y` is equal to `0`, so we push an arbitrary element into `A` to increase its length by `1` and check `Y` and `X` against the length of `A` again.

We keep doing this until we find out whether `X` is smaller than `Y`.
