# 36. implement LargerThan<A, B>

### Problem

https://bigfrontend.dev/typescript/implement-LargerThan-A-B

#

### Problem Description

Implement `LargerThan<A, B>` to compare two positive integers.

```ts
type A = LargerThan<0, 1>; // false
type B = LargerThan<1, 0>; // true
type C = LargerThan<10, 9>; // true
```

#

### Solution

```ts
type LargerThan<
  A extends number,
  B extends number,
  R extends number[] = []
> = A extends R['length']
  ? false
  : B extends R['length']
  ? true
  : LargerThan<A, B, [...R, A]>;
```

### Explanation

Since we cannot compare `A` and `B` directly and both of them are distinct non-negative integers, to solve this problem, we can make use of an array and compare `A` and `B` to the length of the array respectively. Initially, the array is going to be empty, so the length of the array is going to be `0`.

First we check whether or not `A` is equal to the length of the array using `extends`. If it is, then it means `A` is `0`, then `B` is for sure greater than `A`, so we can return `false`; otherwise if we get through the check, then it means `A` is greater than `0`, so we check `B` against the length. If `B` is equal to the length, then `B` is equal to `0` and `A` is definitely greater than `B`, so return false; otherwise it means `B` is also greater than `0`, so we need to increase the length of the array by adding a value into the array, and check `A` as well as `B` against its length again. We keep doing this process until one of them is equal to the length of the array.
