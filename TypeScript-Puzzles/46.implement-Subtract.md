# 46. implement Subtract<A, B>

### Problem

https://bigfrontend.dev/typescript/Subtract-A-B

#

### Problem Description

Similar to [38. implement Add<A, B>](https://bigfrontend.dev/typescript/implement-Add-A-B), please implement `Subtract<A, B>`.

1. only need to consider positive integers
2. B is guaranteed to be smaller or equal to A

```ts
type A = Subtract<1, 1>; // 0
type B = Subtract<10, 3>; // 7
type C = Subtract<3, 10>; // never
```

#

### Solution 1

```ts
type _Subtract<X extends any[], Y extends any[]> = Y extends [
  infer YF,
  ...infer YR
]
  ? X extends [infer XF, ...infer XR]
    ? _Subtract<XR, YR>
    : never
  : X['length'];

type Subtract<
  A extends number,
  B extends number,
  X extends any[] = [],
  Y extends any[] = []
> = X['length'] extends A
  ? Y['length'] extends B
    ? _Subtract<X, Y>
    : Subtract<A, B, X, [...Y, 1]>
  : Subtract<A, B, [...X, 1], Y>;
```

### Explanation

Since only positive integers need to be considered, we can implement `Subtract<A, B>` with the help of arrays. We first create two arrays `X` and `Y` of size `A` and `B`. Then we pass the two arrays to our helper `_Subtract<X, Y>`, which keeps removing one element from each of the two arrays. When `Y` is empty, the number of remaining elements in `X` is the difference between `A` and `B`. If we run into the case where `X` is empty but `Y` is not, then it means `B` is greater than `A`, so we return `never`.

### Solution 2

```ts
type SmallerThan<
  X extends number,
  Y extends number,
  A extends any[] = []
> = A['length'] extends Y
  ? false
  : A['length'] extends X
  ? true
  : SmallerThan<X, Y, [...A, 1]>;

type Subtract<
  A extends number,
  B extends number,
  I extends any[] = [],
  D extends any[] = []
> = SmallerThan<A, B> extends true
  ? never
  : SmallerThan<I['length'], B> extends true
  ? Subtract<A, B, [...I, 1], D>
  : SmallerThan<I['length'], A> extends true
  ? Subtract<A, B, [...I, 1], [...D, 1]>
  : D['length'];
```

### Explanation

Suppose we have an array of size `A`. Let `A = 5` and `B = 2`. The array is going to be `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`. We can notice the difference between `A` and `B` is equal to the number of elements from index `2`, which is equal to `B`, to `4`, which is equal to `A - 1`.

Based on this observation, we can initialize an empty array `I` that is going to keep track of the index we are currently at, and use another array `D` to store the elements from index `B` to index `A - 1`. While the length of `I` is less than `B`, we keep pushing an arbitrary element into `I`. When the length of `I` is equal to `B`, which means our current index is equal to `B`, we start pushing element into both `D` and `I`. When the size of `I` is equal to `A`, the size of `D` is the difference between `A` and `B`.
