# 37. implement SmallerThan<A, B>

### Problem

https://bigfrontend.dev/typescript/implement-SmallerThan-A-B

#

### Problem Description

Implement `SmallerThan<A, B>` to compare two positive integers.

```ts
type A = SmallerThan<0, 1>; // true
type B = SmallerThan<1, 0>; // false
type C = SmallerThan<10, 9>; // false
```

#

### Solution

```ts
type SmallerThan<
  A extends number,
  B extends number,
  R extends number[] = []
> = A extends B
  ? false
  : A extends R['length']
  ? true
  : B extends R['length']
  ? false
  : SmallerThan<A, B, [...R, A]>;
```

### Explanation

`A` and `B` are not necessarily going to be unique, and if they are equal to each other, we should return `false`. So we first use `A extends B` to check if they are equal to each other. Then we make use of an array and check `A` and `B` against the length of the array to find out whether `A` is smaller than `B`.

We initialize the array to be empty, so its length is `0`. If `A` is equal to the length, then it means `A` is `0`, and `B` is for sure greater than `A`, since both `A` and `B` are non-negative integers and we have already checked whether or not they are equal to each other, so we return `true`. Otherwise it means `A` is greater than `0`, we then check `B` against the length of the array. If it is equal to the length, then `B` is `0`, so `A` is greater than `B` and we return `false`; else it means `B` is also greater than `0`, so we need to increase the length of the array by pushing an element into the array and check `A` and `B` against its length again. We keep doing this process until one of them is equal to the length of the array.
