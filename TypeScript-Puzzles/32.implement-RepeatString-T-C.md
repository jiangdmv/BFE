# 32. implement RepeatString<T, C>

### Problem

https://bigfrontend.dev/typescript/implement-RepeatString-string-number

#

### Problem Description

Similar to `String.prototype.repeat()`, implement `RepeatString<T, C>` to create a new type by repeating string `T` for `C` times.

```ts
type A = RepeatString<'a', 3>; // 'aaa'
type B = RepeatString<'a', 0>; // ''
```

**Note**

There is no need to handle negative case of C.

#

### Solution

```ts
type RepeatString<
  Type extends string,
  Count extends number,
  Original extends string = Type,
  Array extends string[] = [Type]
> = Count extends 0
  ? ''
  : Array['length'] extends Count
  ? Type
  : RepeatString<`${Type}${Original}`, Count, Original, [...Array, Original]>;
```

### Explanation

We can solve this problem using recursion.

We initialize an array to contain the original string. At every recursive call we append the original string to the array and pass down the array, so that we can keep track of how many times we have repeated the original string through the length of the array.

We also store the original string and pass it down at every recursive call, so that we can append it to `Type` as well as to the array of the original strings. The repeated `Type` is the new input Type.

If `Count` is equal to `0`, return an empty string, else if the length of the array is equal to `Count`, then it means we have repeated the original string for `Count` times, return the input `Type`. These are both of base cases in the recursive function.
